# Part 3: Choosing your paradigm

[Part 2][6]

**Target audiance**: People who likes programming languages - *4 minute read.*

## Implications of checking the types of bindings

Typos and inconsistencies are easy to do in Clojure. The Haskell type checker
largely removes this risk. One of the main things you'll have to get used to is
the handeling of sum types. With sum types (types which can take one of
multiple distinct values) the type checker forces us to handle all cases. For
example, there is no concept of null (nil) in haskell. Instead, you can use the
`Maybe a` to describe the situation where you might have a value of type `a` or
not. If you attempt to retrieve a record from the database, the result can be
modelled with `Maybe DatabaseRecord` if `DatabaseRecord` is the type of your
database record. `Maybe Record` is a disjoint type that can take exactly one of
the possible Values, `Nothing` if the database value retrieval failed or `Just
DatabaseRecord` if the database value retrieval was successful.

Other direct implications include:

* Discovering a library function without having to write it yourself using
  [hoogle][7]
* Know what a function does by only reading the type signature. A classic
  example is the type signature `id :: a -> a`, which only can be implemented
  one way
* Know what a function does only by reading the well-defined name and type
  signature. Consider (Haskell) `List.Split.chunksOf :: Int -> [a] -> [[a]]`)
  vs (Clojure) `(defn chunks-of [n xs] ...)`
* Knowing when side effects occur and what kind. A function declaration of type
  `fetch :: URL -> AJAX String` makes it pretty clear that an AJAX side effect
  takes place upon returning a String.
* Ability to refactor out a piece of your code, and easily detect if something
  broke.

The things that the type checker gives us are helpful and makes writing most
programs easier. However, the counter-argument is usually that these things
really arn't that important in large scale programming projects.

## Programming in the large

Let's consider real programs in the real world. Real world programs:

1. Are not elegant.
2. Run continuously over an extended period of time.
3. Deal with real world irregularity.
4. Interact with other systems.
5. Interact with humans.

This makes it hard to enforce rules and constraints once the system grows.

And now to the biggest problem of software engineering one: misconception of
problem domain. This is a problem that applies to all engineers in all fields
and paradigms. And this problem can not be type checked.

It is not feasable to try to fix peoples misunderstanding of what they are
trying to do with constraints and guardrails. Often, thinks that work best
nobody knows how to explain, like how to drive a car or how to play the game
go. We use information driven methods such as ML in order to solve them, not
strict logic.

## The difference between a static and a dynamic language

In the real world, information dominates logic. Data is fluid and
unpredictable. In order to deal with that, there are two seperate approaches.

1. Make your program should be dynamically extensible, and open, and let the
   data come to you.
2. Try to understand your data and model your problem depending on that.

But the fact of the matter is, we have both and we'll always have both. The
question is only where you draw the line. Consider:

If you have a really open system you still have to define a well-defined
interface to be able to do something useful. Otherwise you just know one single
thing about your data: it's existence. At this point you're gradually turning
your program static, and less flexible for changes. This turns into a paradox.

Because of this paradox, we have the clash between the static and the dynamic
world. So how do we choose?

## Choosing between a dynamic and a static programming language

### First attempt: "Use the right tool for the job"

This is a popular saying in the community, but the problem is that this is a
zero-information statement. The point being that it's impossible to know what
you are supposed to do before doing it. So, we rely on experience. But how can
we be sure that what has been done before by someone in our team is the optimal
way to go?

#### Second attempt: Your view on the world

The only thing left is to turn philosophical. There is a theory called
platonism, that states that there is some universal truth behind all of
mathematics. For example, a circle drawn on a piece of paper thats not a circle
but merely a projection of the circle in the physical world. A circle is
something abstract that does not originate from niether the physical world or
the mental world of our minds. It exists in a third world, disconnected from
the mental and physical world, the world of truth.

The complementary theory is known as formalism. Formalism states that it is
possible for anyone can sit down with a pen and paper and write down a number
of axioms, from which you derive _all_ of mathematics. As a side-note, GÃ¶del
showed that there are some things in mathematics that cannot be derived like
this. On the other hand, the curry-howard-lambek isomorphism states that
different fields in mathematics have a one-to-one correspondance, ie they are
the same.

Can you identify with one of these philosophies? If you can, you can finally
choose programming paradigm.

1. You're a platonist. You believe that mathematics and the universe has some
   universal truth disjoint from our (current) understanding. You shouldn't try
   to set up your own rules and enforce theories of understanding the world.
   Use Clojure as your tool as it helps you describe the world without
   restrictions.

2. You're a formalist. You believe that the fact that the "same" math was
   discovered at different places at different times shows that there is som
   inherent structure in our understanding and that we can control our own
   mind. We make our own mental models and we change them as needed. Use
   haskell as your tool since the language lets you describe structure better.

No matter what thoughts and viewpoints you have today: Remember to stay open!
As craftsmen, we are really proud on our knowledge and our craft and it usually
hurts admitting that we might have done something wrong for a long time.
