# Starting a Blog
If you have found this particular location of the internet, you'll probably be
thrilled to know that I'm starting a blog.The intention is to use this to
document my learning, both for myself and for others. Since evrybody has a blog
these days (no matter if people read it or not) I figured I could have one as
well. The topics is going to be math, programming, tech and probably some
squash.
