# Starting a Blog
So yes, I'm starting a new blog at this particular point of the internet. The
intention is to use this to document my learning, both for myself and for
others. And since evrybody has a blog these days (no matter if people read it
or not) I figured I could have one as well. The topics is going to be math,
programming, tech and probably some sports. I'll to give an idea of the
timespan and potential audience in the header of each post. Enjoy!
